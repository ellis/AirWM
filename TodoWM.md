* [x] maximize the "Desktop" type window
* [ ] supply list of windows to wmctrl (`_NET_CLIENT_LIST` or `_WIN_CLIENT_LIST`)
* [ ] put desktop on all workspaces
* [ ] refactor Workspace and Workspaces into ES6 classes
* [ ] refactor classes to put common functionality into bases classes
* [ ] automatically make space for `_NET_WM_WINDOW_TYPE_DOCK`, such as lxqt-panel
* [ ] Container: redraw functionality should be moved to Layout objects
* [ ] Window: the `move` and `moveFocus` functions should perhaps be moved to Container

Later:
* [ ] allow for different desktops on different workspaces
* [ ] figure out some form of 'show desktop' functionality
